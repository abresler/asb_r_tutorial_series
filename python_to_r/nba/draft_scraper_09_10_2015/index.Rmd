This is the first of what I hope will be on an ongoing series with the world class hoops heads at <a href='http://nyloncalculus.com' target='_blank'>Nylon Calculus</a> exploring learning Data Science through NBA Basketball. This tutorial will teach you how to recreate the results of <a href='https://twitter.com/Savvas_tj' target='_blank'>Savvas Tjortjoglou’s</a> fantastic piece on using <a href='http://python.org/' target='_blank'>Python</a> to <a href='http://nyloncalculus.com/2015/09/07/nylon-calculus-101-data-scraping-with-python//' target='_blank'>extract historic NBA draft data</a> except we will be using R.  I've also decided to add a few new things to mix it up a little bit as well. Finally, if you have yet to read Savvas's piece I highly recommend you do so.

This and any future tutorials are not intended to be construed as:
</p>
<div class="ui bulleted divided list">
 <div class="item">
An endorsement of R as the best programming language.
</div>
<div class="item">
A characterization of Python as a bad or inferior language.

<p>
As I detailed in my <a href='http://asbcllc.com/presentations/si_hackathon/#/' target='_blank'>Sports Illustrated Hackathon keynote presentation</a>, it doesn’t matter which programming language you pick so long as you master it to and use your skills to solve problems.
</p>
<p>
Any of the major programming languages {R, Python, JavaScript, C, ect..} with some expertise empower you to do the truly amazing things that programming languages can do! If you are a true amateur I’d advocate taking some time to learn about the major languages and then deciding which you think is best suited for you to learn.
</p>
<p>
That said, this and future tutorials <strong>are</strong> intended to destroy some misconceptions about the language that I love, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)' target='_blank'>R</a>. There are myths you may come across that imply R is inferior to Python for web-scraping, that it’s syntax doesn’t make sense and that the language is too hard to learn.
<p><strong>None of these things are true</strong> and I hope by the end of this post, whatever your existing programming language of choice is, learned or intended to be learned, you won’t disagree with this statement.</p>

The final step before we are ready for action is to ensure you have the necessary R packages installed and loaded. I am using the development version of many of these packages, so a word caution there. </p>
<p>For those who need to install the packages, I’ve referenced the github repos in the comments, just copy and paste the code starting at <code>devtools::</code> until the end the line into the console or in a script that you can run. For the non development packages just copy and paste starting from <code>install.packages</code> and do the same as before.</p>

```{r eval=TRUE, tidy=F, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
packages <- #These are the packages we need
  c(
    'devtools', # install.packages(devtools)
    'dplyr', # devtools::install_github('hadley/dplyr') 
    'magrittr', # devtools::install_github('smbache/magrittr')

Time to Go Data Treasure Hunting

<div class="ui center aligned basic segment">
<p>
In order to mine for NBA draft data gold we need to know a few things, the most important of which being what years has the draft has existed?
</p>
<p>
To answer this question we navigate our browsers here <code><a href = 'http://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/' target="_blank">http://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/</a></code>. It looks like the draft has existed since <strong>1947</strong> if you include the NBA’s precursor league the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_Association_of_America' target="_blank">BAA</a> and <strong>1950</strong> if you don’t.
</p>
<p>
We are almost ready to start mining we just need to pick a draft year to test. Given that it was the year this distinguished author’s birth, let’s go with <strong>1983</strong>. From the main draft index page click on the <code><a href = 'http://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1983.html'  target="_blank">1983 Draft</a></code> link.
</p>
<p>
Look at all that beautiful data just waiting for us to suck in, I am giddy.
</p>
<div class="ui hidden divider"></div>
<img class = "ui centered large image" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/jDpKEDa83adRm/giphy.gif" title = "Bosh Yea">
<div class="ui hidden divider"></div>
<p>
However, before we get ahead of ourselves thinking we’ve unlocked the magic formula to bringing data we long to explore into R we must find one more key input. This important missing piece is the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS' target = '_blank' >CSS</a> identifier of the data we want from the page, in this case the draft table. Think of this piece of information as unique identifier for the the html data on the page we want.
</p>
<p>
Remember that SelectorGadget I mentioned earlier? It’s time to use it to extract the CSS identifier we need.
<div class="ui bulleted divided list">

During this next portion of the tutorial we are going to write code that will port the NBA draft data into a <code><a href = 'http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/data-frame' target = '_blank'>data frame</a></code>. We are going to use the excellent <code><a>rvest</a></code> package accomplish much of this. Essentially our code is going to:
<div class="ui bulleted divided list">
 <div class="item">
Create the URL where the data lives
</div>
 <div class="item">
Use the URL to navigate to the page
</div>
 <div class="item">
Capture the page in R
</div>
<div class="item">
Identify draft table
</div>
<div class="item">
Put the table into a data frame.
</div>
<div class="item">
Clean the messy imported data
</div>
</p>
</div>
<p>
However, before we complete those steps I want to <strong>enlighten</strong> our code. By that I mean I want to teach our code to be aware of the context of the data we are collecting. This will make our code self adjusting so we don’t have to update our code over and over again as new drafts occur {assuming the HTML structure of the page where the data lives doesn’t change, a far from fail proof assumption}.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, we are going to teach our code to allow us to only search for draft years that are completed. We are also going to teach our code how to differentiate between a BAA and NBA draft while simultaneously telling us which one we picked. We also want our code to tell us if we are searching for an ineligible draft year and stop what it is doing if we happen to make this mistake.
</p>
<p>
One major aside, you are going to see me use alot of the symbol <code>%&gt;%</code>, it is a called a <strong>pipe chaining operator</strong>, think of it like the term <strong>then</strong>. I’m a huge fan of chaining, it makes code flow more smoothly and cuts down on the amount of code you need to write. If you are on a Mac you can have R write a pipe easily by pressing <code>command+shift+M</code>, Windows users I believe there is similar syntax as well but I don't know it off the top of my head.
</p>
<p>
Finally, if you are here to try to learn some R, I urge you to try to follow along with my comments by looking for <code>#</code> and in case you are wondering <code><-</code>is how you assign thing in R and <code>%&lt;&gt;%</code> is a beautiful combination of <code>%&gt;%</code> and<code><-</code> much simultaneously takes something, transforms it and assigns it.
</p>

}

url.draft_year <-
  base %>%
  paste0(draft_year, '.html') # creates the url where the data lives

url.draft_year # our url with the data and it should work for any draft year!

```

<div class="ui center aligned basic segment">

Fantastic, this code based upon our selected draft year creates the URL where the draft data lives. Now that we have this we can move on to the fun part <br>

Data Extraction

</p>
<p>
I am going to write some fairly advanced data cleaning code that will use R’s magic to infer player’s corresponding draft round so we can add it as a variable in our data frame, unfortunately Basketball-Reference doesn’t provide that information to us in an easily usable way.

<p>
Believe it or not we are almost done and the hardest parts are behind us. All that is left to do is import the other valuable data from the draft page that being the player’s BREF ID, if it exists, which in turn gives us the player’s BREF profile URL. In addition to that, we want to resolve the BREF team IDs to the actual draft team.
</p>
<p>
The player IDs can be found the same way we brought in the table data, with their CSS identifiers. In this case they are an <code>attribute</code> of the 4th table data column.
</p>
<p>
As for the resolving the team IDs that is more complicated process which I’ve taken the liberty of already doing separately. We are going to just read in that file which contains all the BREF team IDs, the team names, current team ids, and whether the franchise is still in existence.  After collecting and importing that information we will merge it the existing data frame and we will be finished!
</p>
<p>
The final step is a personal preference, though completely unnecessary to the process of learning to be an R coding master. I like to <strong>Messagify</strong> my code, especially when functions are built around the code, and that’s coming next folks. Messages show you that your code is done running and can be tailored to, make you laugh, feel good about your work, or as the case here, learn a potentially random new fact. When we build our functions I will show you how to make Messagifying optional

Now that we know our code is <strong><i>fleek</i></strong> and works like Draymond Green in the paint, it’s time to take our code and turn it into a function we can use whenever we feel like it. As I mentioned earlier, I am going to add in a few lines of code that will make returning a message optional. I am going to rewrite the code from earlier in a consolidated manner so you can just skip to the bottom if you want.

We now have demonstrated that our function works and will provide us for draft data for any valid year we give it. We can take this function and integrate it into another function that will let us pull in the complete NBA/BAA draft history or the specific draft years we want. We already put in the hard work creating the first function, this second function only has a few missing pieces before it will be up and running.
</p>
<p>
We want our function to let us explicitly ask us whether we want the BAA data. We want our code to know what to do if we don’t identify an explicit range of drafts. In this case we want our code to return all the eligible drafts if the range is undefined. Finally Messagify this function to return a random fact about a player in the chosen range.

The function should be loaded into your environment.  Let's test it out.  Since the function is smart and makes assumptions if information isn't given, you don't need to input any assumptions, doing this will return the full NBA draft history inclusive of the BAA drafts.

Today’s tutorial ends here but we now have refined NBA draft data gold ready for all sorts of interesting data analysis and visualization, things R also excels at.
<p>
<p>
Check back soon and for a tutorial that will teach how how to visualize and analyze this dataset.
</p>
<p>
I hope you enjoyed this and recognize that R can do anything that Python does with ease and grace.</p>
<p>
Also, if you ever hear someone say R isn’t good at web-scraping you can shake your head and laugh!
</p>
<p>
You can find the code for the functions <a href = 'https://github.com/abresler/asb_r_tutorial_series/tree/master/python_to_r/nba/draft_scraper_09_10_2015/code' target = '_blank'>here</a> and I urge you to download or fork the repo and use the code whenever you need it!
