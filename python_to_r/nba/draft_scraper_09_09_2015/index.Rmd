<div class="ui basic segment"><p>This is the first of what I hope will be on an ongoing series with the excellent hoops heads over at <a href='http://nyloncalculus.com' target='_blank'>Nylon Calculus</a> that explore learning Data Science through the beautiful lense of NBA Basketball.  This tutorial will teach you how to recreate <a href='https://twitter.com/Savvas_tj' target='_blank'>Savvas Tjortjoglou's</a> fantastic piece on using <a href='http://python.org/' target='_blank'>Python</a> to <a href='http://nyloncalculus.com/2015/09/07/nylon-calculus-101-data-scraping-with-python//' target='_blank'>extract NBA historic draft data</a>.

<div class="ui basic ui inverted red segment"><h2 class="ui header">Word of Caution</h2></div>

<div class="ui basic segment"><p>This and any future tutorials are not intended taken as:</p>
<li>An endorsement of R as the best programming language.</li>
<li>A characterization of Python as a bad language.</li>
<br>
As I detailed in my <a href='http://asbcllc.com/presentations/si_hackathon/#/' target='_blank'>Sports Illustrated Hackathon keynote presentation</a>, it doesn't matter which programming language you pick so long as you master it to empower yourself with MacGuyver like powers.  Any of the major programming languages {R, Python, JavaScript, C, ect..} with some work will let you do the truly amazing things programming languages can do!

That said, this and future tutorials **are** intended to destroy some misconceptions about the language that I love, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)' target='_blank'>R</a>.  There are myths you may come across that imply R is inferior to Python for webscraping, that it's syntax doesn't make sense and that the language is too hard to learn.  None of these things are true and I hope by the end of this post, whatever existing programming language of choice is, learned or intended to be learned, you won't disagree with this statement.

<p>In order to get started we need to make sure you have got all the necessary tools for today's exploration. First make sure you have <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/" target='_blank'>R</a> and <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/" target='_blank'>RStudio</a> installed.  Then if you don't already use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target='_blank'>Firefox</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/" target='_blank'>Chrome</a> pick a browser horse and install it.  Finally, launch your chosen browse and install the <em>fantastic</em> <a href="http://selectorgadget.com/" target='_blank'>SelectorGadget</a> widget. Fire up <img src="http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RStudio-Ball.png" alt="" height = "30px" width = "30px">, because it's game time.
</p>
<p>
The next thing you need to do is to make sure you have necessary packages installed.  I am using the development versions of many of these packages and I have referenced the github repos in the comments for those who need  to install them just copy and paste starting at <code>devtools::</code> until the end the line.  For the non development packages just copy and paste starting from <code>install.packages</code>.
</p>

<div class="ui basic segment">
<p>In order to mine NBA draft data gold we need to know a few things before building our data mining rig the most important of which being what years the draft has existed.</p>
<p>To do this we navigate here <code><a href = 'http://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/' target="_blank">http://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/</a></code>.  It looks like the draft has existed since <strong>1947</strong> if you include the NBA's precursor the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_Association_of_America' target="_blank">BAA</a> and <strong>1950</strong> if you don't.  
</p>
<p>We are nearly ready to start building we just need to pick a draft year to test.  Given that it was the year this author was born let's go with <strong>1983</strong>.  Let's navigate over the <code><a href = 'http://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1983.html'  target="_blank">1983 Draft</a></code> page.  We need one more key input before we can get started and that is the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS' target = '_blank' >CSS</a> id of the data we want from the page, in this case the draft table.</p>
<p>Remember that SelectorGadget I mentioned earlier?  It's time to use it to get the information we need.  Click the widget's button.  Next scroll over the table with the draft information.  You should see something like the picture below</p>
<img class = "ui centered huge image" src="http://i.imgur.com/rdA0pMn.png" title = "css information">

<p>Like the <a href = 'www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5-rdr0qhWk' target = '_blank' >1978 Cars song</a> our trusty SelectorGadget gave us <i>Just What We Needed</i> now it's time to build!</p>

Extract the Data

</div>
<div class="ui inverted blue circular segment">
<h2 class="ui inverted header">
Clean the Data
</h2>
</div>

<div class="ui basic segment">
<p>First thing we need to do use code to take the data from the website and help us bring it into a <code><a href = 'http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/data-frame' target = '_blank'>data frame</a></code>.  We are going to use the excellent <code><a>rvest</a></code> package to begin the data extraction process.  Essentially our code is going to take a URL, capture the page, find the draft table and bring the data into R for data cleaning.  Before we do that I want to make our self adjusting and aware of the constraints of the data we are looking for.
</p>
<p> R, like any programming language is really smart so we want to take advantage of this to help us scale this function and allow it to auto update over time.  To do that we will teach our function to allow us to only search for draft years that exist and know if we are looking at a BAA or NBA draft year.  If we pick an illegible draft year R will tell us and stop what it's doing.</p>
<p>Also one important aside, you are going to see me use alot of the symbol <code>%>%</code> , it is a chaining tool, think of it like the term <strong>then</strong>.  I'm a huge fan of chaining it makes things flow much smoother from start to finish.</p>
<p>Also try to following along with my comments by looking for <code>#</code></p>

<p>Believe it or not we are almost done.

<p>After collecting and importing that data we will merge it do the raw data and we will be done.  I also like to add fun messages to my code, especially when functions are built around it, that's coming next folks.
